<p><em>Note: This was posted on Multiply on September 20, 2008. To view current blog entries, click <a href="http://thegenuisishere.multiply.com" title="Tambayan ng Tamad">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Today, the University of the Philippines (UNPLUG) is celebrating Software Freedom Day (SFD), a day dedicated for the success of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) against an imperialistic digital software world.</p>

<p>Since today is FD, we will talk about FOSS and its success in the corporate market.</p>

<p>FOSS, as said above, is open source and free. Open source means that the code is readily available, meaning that anyone can take a look at the code, improve ot, and use it for creating other applications, provided certain license conditions are met. Meanwhile, the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù means the usage of the software binds you to no specific company, though the software itself may be or may not free in terms of cost, though open source software is a lot cheaper compared to closed software.</p>

<p>Open source software is currently gaining popularity, and some reasons are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Free. Although not all, open source software is generally free of charge. And the freedom from a specific company implies that you can make multiple copies of the software without fearing of piracy charges.</li>
  <li>Open Source. Because the code is open for viewing and editing, developers are free to make modifications and improvements to the code. And since it is open source, the code can be modified and/or integrated to other programs, provided certain license agreements are followed.</li>
  <li>Support. Though not as good as those provided by closed source software makers (though this is changing), software support is widely available, ranging from the official documentation made by the programmer(s) to the online forums that proliferate the net.</li>
  <li>Popularity. With the growing popularity of open source, it is expected that many programmers write more open source alternatives to current closed software.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, opposition is always available:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Market domination. Closed source software, such as Microsoft Windows, dominate the market, and therefore have a greater hold of the market share. This is augmented by the fact that the open source movement only started during the ‚Äô90s, a somewhat late timing.</li>
  <li>Refusal to change. Because switching from a popular program to a not-so-popular one entails cost, most people refuse to change.</li>
  <li>Compatibility. Some open source programs are simply not compatible with the currently in-use systems. Also, the people themselves may not be comfortable of using the alternative.</li>
  <li>Popularity. Closed source software, also called proprietary programs, are more popular than their open-source counterparts, e.g. Adobe Photoshop over GIMP.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Some Open Source Programs</strong>If you are willing to experiment, here are some of the open source programs that you can try. Some of them are already popular, and some may need some time to master. Almost all of these programs don‚Äôt cost a centavo, and are available for download.</p>
