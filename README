Current workng setup:
- jekyll 4.3.4
- Ruby gems installed via Arch's pacman:
	- ruby-ffi
	- ruby-erb
	- ruby-maruku
	- ruby-nokogiri
	- ruby-racc
	- ruby-rb-inotify
	- ruby-sass
	- ruby-webrick
- If you want to `bundle install` in Arch, you might want to **temporarily** grant write access to the `others` group of the following folders. Return them to `755` afterwards to avoid pacman complaining.
	- /usr/bin
	- /usr/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/\
- For `encrypt`:
	- Original code: https://github.com/xct/jekyll-encrypt
	- We are moving away to its original implem due to jekyll install complications in Arch Linux
	- Current rb is in `_plugins/encrypt2.rb`, tested working in ruby 3.3.5 and jekyll 4.3.4
	- Also see this for workaround in post.content: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4714#issuecomment-224494030
- Jekyll is quite hard to debug, so be prepared for headaches
