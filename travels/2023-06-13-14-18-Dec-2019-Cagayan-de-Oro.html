  <li>Opol is a nice place to relax, especially if you like nature and trekking.</li>
  <li>If you are going to the vicinity of my uncle‚Äôs house, it is highly recommended to have a transportation of your own as the place is quite remote. Mountain bikers might find it great, as as you are cycling up and down a mountain.</li>
  <li>As with travel in general, <strong>go either by yourself or with like-minded friends</strong>. If you like to venture out into the unknown, do not be with a family that just want to lounge and gossip around. Consider this especially if you‚Äôre the one financing the trip.</li>

<hr />

<p>I have never ridden an airplane before. So when my aunt invited us to vacation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagayan_de_Oro">Cagayan de Or</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230608005625/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagayan_de_Oro">o</a> on the island of Mindanao, you bet I‚Äôm excited.</p>

<p>It turns out this trip was celebration of her retirement. The vacation was scheduled on December 14 to 18. We‚Äôre staying on her brother‚Äôs (our uncle) residence in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opol">Opo</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230608005445/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opol">l</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently being a computer-savvy person makes one responsible to book a flight online, so I did. I can‚Äôt remember if an effort was made to min-max the prices, but we definitely didn‚Äôt take advantage of promos. So the prices might not have been the best.</p>

<p>We booked a five-person flight on <abbr title="Philippine Airlines">PAL</abbr> on March 2019. Below is a copy of my receipt.</p>

<p>As you can see, the airport of origin was Clark in Angeles, Pampanga. As the months went by, it was eventually moved to <abbr title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">NAIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>My brother also wanted to come and booked himself an Air Asia ticket on November. Like me, he has not flown ever.</p>

<p>Finally, the day of the flight came. We were on the airport by 04:00, lounging, sleeping, waiting. We were airborne by 09:00, <abbr title="Philippine Airlines">PAL</abbr> providing complimentary snacks and coffee. We touched down at <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> airport before lunch.</p>

<p>After waiting for my brother at <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> airport and having lunch, our uncle drove us to his home up in the mountains of Opol. It was secluded, with limited internet reception.</p>

<p>Below are the highlights while in Mindanao:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the 15th, we visited an observation deck. Below are some pictures.</li>

<ul>
  <li>By the afternoon of the 15th, we had lunch at <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr>‚Äôs city center. Apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Davao_del_Sur_earthquake">an earthquake struck Davao del Sur </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230610131305/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Davao_del_Sur_earthquake">on 14:11 <abbr title="Philippine Standard Time">PST</abbr></a>, which was recorded in <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> as intensity III. My relatives felt it; those lounging in the car said they felt it jolt. People came out of the mall. I did feel it, but was disappointed by the weakness. Yes, I‚Äôm looking forward to experiencing a strong earthquake; I‚Äôm <em>that</em> weird.</li>
  <li>On the morning of the 16th, we went to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a1bp7arzF2SGB9Kw5">Opol Ostrich and Crocodile Farm</a>, seeing ostriches and peacocks in person for the first time. The place is quite remote and unremarkable. It‚Äôs like going to a backyard farm that is being forced to be an agrotourism site. The only picture that I have unfortunately are these ostrich eggs. They sell empty shells for house decoration/souvenir purposes. I wanted to buy one but my brother doesn‚Äôt want to (he‚Äôs the one who will fly it home), so no dice.<br />
<img src="https://arden-chan.party/assets/images/2023-06-13-14-18-Dec-2019-Cagayan-de-Oro/ostrich-eggs.jpg" alt="Ostrich eggs" /></li>
  <li>By afternoon, my uncle took us to his extensive lands up in the mountains of Opol. According to him, it‚Äôs classified as forest land and is quite cheap. He grows fruit trees on part of it. He wants to sell to me some of the forested land, so this doubles as an ocular ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù. By 17:00, an interesting thing happened: one of my bosses called me. I think he forgot I was on a one week leave (yes, I filed the paperwork!) as he was asking if I can go to his cubicle to discuss work. I find it funny not for him forgetting I was on leave but for the fact that the internet reception up in the mountains is <em>very</em> clear compared to my uncle‚Äôs house where it‚Äôs practically non-existent.</li>
  <li>Drama amongst my mother‚Äôs siblings is the nightly entertainment, mainly on how the wife of one of their brothers is driving a wedge between them by brainwashing and isolating him. Quite the soap opera, especially if you have nothing to do because you‚Äôre forbidden to explore on your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>The five-day vacation eventually came to a close on the 18th. We departed by 11:30 from <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> airport and arrived at <abbr title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">NAIA</abbr> by 13:00. This time, I was able to take clips while on air.</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class="embed-container">    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/h1G4w02ql8Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>I was also able to take this picture of the isthmus of Metro Manila.</p>

<p><img src="https://arden-chan.party/assets/images/2023-06-13-14-18-Dec-2019-Cagayan-de-Oro/isthmus-of-manila.jpg" alt="Isthmus of Metro Manila" /></p>

<p>Picture quality notwithstanding (excuse the crappy camera), I was taken aback by the ugliness of the isthmus. My boss later told me that this looks beautiful at night. Perhaps that‚Äôs true (I might try a night flight in the future to verify), but for a nature lover like me I just think that glorifies light pollution. But I guess different people like different things.</p>

<p>My brother left <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> around 14:00 and arrived at <abbr title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">NAIA</abbr> by 16:00.</p>

<p>After eating at a nearby Mang Inasal, the trip officially ended with all parties going home. My aunt and her children traveled back to Pangasinan that night, while me, my brother, and my mom stayed in a condominium in Mandaluyong.</p>

<p>My thoughts about the vacation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Philippine Airlines">PAL</abbr> is a nice airline to book a flight. In contrast, my brother says Air Asia is the worst: the seats are cramped and there is little to no legroom; there was no complimentary food either.</li>
  <li>Opol is a nice place to relax. If you‚Äôre a trekker, I think you would love it there.</li>
  <li>If you are going to the vicinity of my uncle‚Äôs house, it is highly recommended to have a transportation of your own, whether it‚Äôs a mountain bike, a car, or a truck, as the place is quite remote. If going by bicycle, expect dirt paths and steep gradients.</li>
  <li>If you have a family that is not adventurous, <strong>it is best to leave them</strong>. Reworded, <strong>go either by yourself or with like-minded friends</strong>. Otherwise, you‚Äôll just waste your time waiting for interesting things to happen. This is more true if you are the one financing the trip; it will be a big waste of time, money, and emotions adapting to people you don‚Äôt like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I may go back to <abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr> in the future. Most likely, I‚Äôll just opt for a hotel stay; the thousands of pesos I‚Äôll spend for one is worth more than the constant nagging and surveillance of relatives.</p>
